                            to cooking.

                            <br>
                            <p>There are many times in my life, when I could've thrown in the towel. Many times in my life when I was on the floor.
                                 And when you're on the floor, never allow anybody to pick you up. It doesn't matter how long you stay there, make
                                  sure you pick yourself up and dust yourself down. Whatever happens, whether you go home today or you don't go
                                   home today, that's irrelevant. What's relevant, is you take the knowledge from the experience and you grow as a person.</p>
